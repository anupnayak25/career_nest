# CareerNest React Native client (JavaScript)

This is a JS-based React Native client that mirrors the core flows of the Flutter app in `app/`:

- Auth: OTP -> Signup, Signin (Email/Password)
- Role-based dashboards (Admin/Faculty vs Student)
- Home and Profile
- Video record & upload to backend API
- Notifications (placeholder)

## Structure

- `App.js`: Root app with navigation and auth provider
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.jsx`: Auth stack + Tab navigation
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`: Manages token and user state via AsyncStorage
- `src/services/api.js`: Axios client for backend (`/api`)
- `src/config/index.js`: API base URL config (local vs emulator)
- `src/screens/*`: Screens for the app

## Backend

Set `SECRET_KEY` and MySQL env vars and run the backend from `backend/` (default port 5000). The client points to:

- Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:5000`
- iOS simulator / Metro host: `http://localhost:5000`

You can override via env: `API_BASE_URL`.

## Run

- Start Metro
	- `npm start`
- Android
	- `npm run android`
- iOS (requires macOS)
	- `npm run ios`

## Notes

- Push notifications (FCM) are not wired yet; the screen is a stub.
- If you see reanimated errors, ensure Babel has the plugin (already added in `babel.config.js`) and the app is rebuilt.
- Vector icons use the monorepo package; you can migrate to per-family packages later.
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
